<h1>My Summer Vacation!</h1>

<p>My summer vacation took place in 4 different states. The first state was home in South Carolina.</p>

<h2>First stop: My home state: South Carolina</h2>

<p2>In SC, at the begining of summer vacation, I enjoyed not having to do anything school related. I watch tv, ate several meals and snacks, when shopping, and went to a summer camp.</p2>

<h2> The summer camp</h2>

<p3>The summer camp I went to was <b>CREATEng</b>, a camp for the <b>SC's Governer school for Science and Mathematics (GSSM)</b>. This is the <a href="https://www.scgssm.org/outreach-camps/createng"><b>CREATEng website</b></a>. At this camp, you learn engineering by using mathemathics, science, and technology. You work on many projects and at the end of the week you have a showcase.</p3>
